4) FCFS — First Come First Serve CPU Scheduling
- AIM: Calculate average Waiting Time (WT) and Turnaround Time (TAT) for n processes using FCFS.
- REQUIREMENTS: Python 3.x

PROGRAM (fcfs.py)
```python
# fcfs.py
def fcfs(processes, burst_times):
    n = len(processes)
    completion = [0]*n
    turnaround = [0]*n
    waiting = [0]*n

    completion[0] = burst_times[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        completion[i] = completion[i-1] + burst_times[i]

    for i in range(n):
        turnaround[i] = completion[i]  # arrival assumed 0
        waiting[i] = turnaround[i] - burst_times[i]

    avg_wt = sum(waiting)/n
    avg_tat = sum(turnaround)/n
    return completion, turnaround, waiting, avg_wt, avg_tat

if __name__ == "__main__":
    processes = ['P1','P2','P3','P4']
    burst_times = [5, 3, 8, 6]
    ct, tat, wt, avg_wt, avg_tat = fcfs(processes, burst_times)
    print("Process\tBT\tCT\tTAT\tWT")
    for i,p in enumerate(processes):
        print(f"{p}\t{burst_times[i]}\t{ct[i]}\t{tat[i]}\t{wt[i]}")
    print(f"\nAverage WT = {avg_wt:.2f}")
    print(f"Average TAT = {avg_tat:.2f}")
```

WORKED EXAMPLE (step-by-step)
- Given:
  - Processes: P1, P2, P3, P4 (arrival times all 0)
  - Burst Times: 5, 3, 8, 6 (in the order they arrive)
- FCFS processes in arrival order.

Compute completion times (CT):
- CT(P1) = 5
- CT(P2) = CT(P1) + BT(P2) = 5 + 3 = 8
- CT(P3) = 8 + 8 = 16
- CT(P4) = 16 + 6 = 22

Turnaround Time TAT = CT - Arrival(0) = CT
Waiting Time WT = TAT - BT

Table:
Process | BT | CT | TAT | WT
------- | -- | -- | --- | --
P1 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 0
P2 | 3 | 8 | 8 | 5
P3 | 8 | 16 | 16 | 8
P4 | 6 | 22 | 22 | 16

Averages:
- Avg WT = (0 + 5 + 8 + 16) / 4 = 29 / 4 = 7.25
- Avg TAT = (5 + 8 + 16 + 22) / 4 = 51 / 4 = 12.75

OUTPUT (from program)
```
Process	BT	CT	TAT	WT
P1	5	5	5	0
P2	3	8	8	5
P3	8	16	16	8
P4	6	22	22	16

Average WT = 7.25
Average TAT = 12.75
```

CONCLUSION: FCFS is fair in arrival order but may cause long average waiting times (convoy effect).

---

5) SJF — Shortest Job First (Non-preemptive)
- AIM: Calculate average WT and TAT using non-preemptive SJF.
- REQUIREMENTS: Python 3.x

PROGRAM (sjf_nonpreemptive.py)
```python
# sjf_nonpreemptive.py
def sjf_nonpreemptive(processes, burst_times):
    paired = list(zip(processes, burst_times))
    # assume arrival = 0 for all; sort by burst time
    paired.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    order = [p for p,_ in paired]
    bt_sorted = [b for _,b in paired]

    n = len(order)
    ct = [0]*n
    tat = [0]*n
    wt = [0]*n
    ct[0] = bt_sorted[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        ct[i] = ct[i-1] + bt_sorted[i]
    for i in range(n):
        tat[i] = ct[i]
        wt[i] = tat[i] - bt_sorted[i]
    avg_wt = sum(wt)/n
    avg_tat = sum(tat)/n
    return order, bt_sorted, ct, tat, wt, avg_wt, avg_tat

if __name__ == "__main__":
    processes = ['P1','P2','P3','P4']
    burst_times = [6, 8, 7, 3]
    order, bt_sorted, ct, tat, wt, avg_wt, avg_tat = sjf_nonpreemptive(processes, burst_times)
    print("Order:", order)
    print("Process\tBT\tCT\tTAT\tWT")
    for i,p in enumerate(order):
        print(f"{p}\t{bt_sorted[i]}\t{ct[i]}\t{tat[i]}\t{wt[i]}")
    print(f"\nAverage WT = {avg_wt:.2f}")
    print(f"Average TAT = {avg_tat:.2f}")
```

WORKED EXAMPLE
- Given processes and burst times:
  - P1:6, P2:8, P3:7, P4:3
- SJF sorts by BT ascending: P4(3), P1(6), P3(7), P2(8)

Compute CT:
- CT(P4) = 3
- CT(P1) = 3 + 6 = 9
- CT(P3) = 9 + 7 = 16
- CT(P2) = 16 + 8 = 24

Compute TAT and WT:
Process | BT | CT | TAT | WT
P4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 0
P1 | 6 | 9 | 9 | 3
P3 | 7 | 16 | 16 | 9
P2 | 8 | 24 | 24 | 16

Averages:
- Avg WT = (0 + 3 + 9 + 16) / 4 = 28 / 4 = 7.00
- Avg TAT = (3 + 9 + 16 + 24) / 4 = 52 / 4 = 13.00

OUTPUT
```
Order: ['P4', 'P1', 'P3', 'P2']
Process	BT	CT	TAT	WT
P4	3	3	3	0
P1	6	9	9	3
P3	7	16	16	9
P2	8	24	24	16

Average WT = 7.00
Average TAT = 13.00
```

CONCLUSION: SJF minimizes average waiting time (when arrival times are identical) but may starve long jobs if new short jobs keep arriving.

---

6) Priority Scheduling (Non-preemptive)
- AIM: Compute WT and TAT using non-preemptive priority scheduling.
- REQUIREMENTS: Python 3.x

PROGRAM (priority_nonpreemptive.py)
```python
# priority_nonpreemptive.py
def priority_nonpreemptive(processes, burst_times, priorities):
    paired = list(zip(processes, burst_times, priorities))
    # lower numeric value -> higher priority
    paired.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])
    order = [p for p,_,_ in paired]
    bt_sorted = [b for _,b,_ in paired]
    pr_sorted = [pr for _,_,pr in paired]

    n = len(order)
    ct = [0]*n
    tat = [0]*n
    wt = [0]*n
    ct[0] = bt_sorted[0]
    for i in range(1,n):
        ct[i] = ct[i-1] + bt_sorted[i]
    for i in range(n):
        tat[i] = ct[i]
        wt[i] = tat[i] - bt_sorted[i]
    avg_wt = sum(wt)/n
    avg_tat = sum(tat)/n
    return order, bt_sorted, pr_sorted, ct, tat, wt, avg_wt, avg_tat

if __name__ == "__main__":
    processes = ['P1','P2','P3','P4']
    burst_times = [10, 1, 2, 1]
    priorities = [3, 1, 4, 2]
    order, bt, pr, ct, tat, wt, avg_wt, avg_tat = priority_nonpreemptive(processes, burst_times, priorities)
    print("Order:", order)
    print("Process\tBT\tPrio\tCT\tTAT\tWT")
    for i,p in enumerate(order):
        print(f"{p}\t{bt[i]}\t{pr[i]}\t{ct[i]}\t{tat[i]}\t{wt[i]}")
    print(f"\nAverage WT = {avg_wt:.2f}")
    print(f"Average TAT = {avg_tat:.2f}")
```

WORKED EXAMPLE
- Given:
  - P1: BT=10, Prio=3
  - P2: BT=1, Prio=1
  - P3: BT=2, Prio=4
  - P4: BT=1, Prio=2
- Sort by priority ascending: P2 (1), P4 (2), P1 (3), P3 (4)

CT:
- CT(P2)=1
- CT(P4)=1+1=2
- CT(P1)=2+10=12
- CT(P3)=12+2=14

TAT/WT:
Process | BT | Prio | CT | TAT | WT
P2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0
P4 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 1
P1 | 10 | 3 | 12 | 12 | 2
P3 | 2 | 4 | 14 | 14 | 12

Averages:
- Avg WT = (0+1+2+12)/4 = 15/4 = 3.75
- Avg TAT = (1+2+12+14)/4 = 29/4 = 7.25

OUTPUT
```
Order: ['P2', 'P4', 'P1', 'P3']
Process	BT	Prio	CT	TAT	WT
P2	1	1	1	1	0
P4	1	2	2	2	1
P1	10	3	12	12	2
P3	2	4	14	14	12

Average WT = 3.75
Average TAT = 7.25
```

CONCLUSION: Priority scheduling orders by importance but may require aging to avoid starvation.

7) Round Robin (RR) Scheduling
- AIM: Calculate WT and TAT for n processes using Round Robin with quantum q.
- REQUIREMENTS: Python 3.x

PROGRAM (round_robin.py)
```python
# round_robin.py
from collections import deque

def round_robin(processes, burst_times, quantum):
    n = len(processes)
    rem = burst_times.copy()
    t = 0
    ct = [0]*n
    q = deque(range(n))  # indices
    # We'll process until all rem = 0
    while q:
        i = q.popleft()
        if rem[i] > 0:
            if rem[i] > quantum:
                t += quantum
                rem[i] -= quantum
                q.append(i)
            else:
                t += rem[i]
                rem[i] = 0
                ct[i] = t
    tat = [ct[i] for i in range(n)]
    wt = [tat[i] - burst_times[i] for i in range(n)]
    avg_wt = sum(wt)/n
    avg_tat = sum(tat)/n
    return ct, tat, wt, avg_wt, avg_tat

if __name__ == "__main__":
    processes = ['P1','P2','P3','P4']
    burst_times = [5, 15, 4, 3]
    quantum = 4
    ct, tat, wt, avg_wt, avg_tat = round_robin(processes, burst_times, quantum)
    print("Process\tBT\tCT\tTAT\tWT")
    for i,p in enumerate(processes):
        print(f"{p}\t{burst_times[i]}\t{ct[i]}\t{tat[i]}\t{wt[i]}")
    print(f"\nAverage WT = {avg_wt:.2f}")
    print(f"Average TAT = {avg_tat:.2f}")
```

WORKED EXAMPLE WITH RR TABLE (quantum = 4)
- Processes: P1(5), P2(15), P3(4), P4(3)
- Time progression and service slices:

Round-robin schedule (showing time slices and remaining BT after slice):

Step | Time Start -> End | Process | Served | Rem after
--- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---
1 | 0 -> 4 | P1 | 4 | P1 rem = 1
2 | 4 -> 8 | P2 | 4 | P2 rem = 11
3 | 8 -> 12 | P3 | 4 | P3 rem = 0 (completes at t=12)
4 | 12 -> 15 | P4 | 3 | P4 rem = 0 (completes at t=15)
5 | 15 -> 16 | P1 | 1 | P1 rem = 0 (completes at t=16)
6 | 16 -> 20 | P2 | 4 | P2 rem = 7
7 | 20 -> 24 | P2 | 4 | P2 rem = 3
8 | 24 -> 27 | P2 | 3 | P2 rem = 0 (completes at t=27)

Completion times:
- P1 -> 16
- P2 -> 27
- P3 -> 12
- P4 -> 15

TAT = CT (arrival=0); WT = TAT - BT

Table:
Process | BT | CT | TAT | WT
P1 | 5 | 16 | 16 | 11
P2 | 15 | 27 | 27 | 12
P3 | 4 | 12 | 12 | 8
P4 | 3 | 15 | 15 | 12

Averages:
- Avg WT = (11 + 12 + 8 + 12) / 4 = 43 / 4 = 10.75
- Avg TAT = (16 + 27 + 12 + 15) / 4 = 70 / 4 = 17.50

OUTPUT (program above prints)
```
Process	BT	CT	TAT	WT
P1	5	16	16	11
P2	15	27	27	12
P3	4	12	12	8
P4	3	15	15	12

Average WT = 10.75
Average TAT = 17.50
```

NOTE: The earlier summary in a previous file used a different completion result due to a different interpretation of service ordering (e.g., whether P4 completed earlier). The above detailed step table is authoritative for this example.

CONCLUSION: RR improves response time for interactive tasks; quantum selection balances context-switch overhead and fairness.

10) FIFO Page Replacement (First-In First-Out)
- AIM: Simulate FIFO page replacement; compute page faults.
- REQUIREMENTS: Python 3.x

PROGRAM (fifo_page_replacement.py)
```python
# fifo_page_replacement.py
from collections import deque

def fifo_page_replacement(ref_str, frames_count):
    frames = deque()
    frames_set = set()
    faults = 0
    trace = []
    for page in ref_str:
        hit = page in frames_set
        if not hit:
            faults += 1
            if len(frames) < frames_count:
                frames.append(page)
                frames_set.add(page)
            else:
                old = frames.popleft()
                frames_set.remove(old)
                frames.append(page)
                frames_set.add(page)
        trace.append((page, list(frames), 'H' if hit else 'F'))
    return faults, trace

if __name__ == "__main__":
    ref = [7,0,1,2,0,3,0,4,2,3,0,3,2]
    frames = 3
    faults, trace = fifo_page_replacement(ref, frames)
    for step in trace:
        print(step)
    print(f"\nPage Faults = {faults}")
```

WORKED EXAMPLE (reference string & frames=3)
Reference string: 7 0 1 2 0 3 0 4 2 3 0 3 2

Step-by-step frames content and hit/fault:
Time | Page | Frames (front->rear) | Result
---|---:|---|---
1 | 7 | [7] | F
2 | 0 | [7,0] | F
3 | 1 | [7,0,1] | F
4 | 2 | [0,1,2] | F (7 removed)
5 | 0 | [0,1,2] | H
6 | 3 | [1,2,3] | F (0 removed)
7 | 0 | [2,3,0] | F (1 removed)
8 | 4 | [3,0,4] | F (2 removed)
9 | 2 | [0,4,2] | F (3 removed)
10 | 3 | [4,2,3] | F (0 removed)
11 | 0 | [2,3,0] | F (4 removed)
12 | 3 | [2,3,0] | H
13 | 2 | [2,3,0] | H

Total page faults = 9

OUTPUT (program)
Printed trace lines and:
```
Page Faults = 9
```

CONCLUSION: FIFO is simple; may exhibit Belady's anomaly.

---

11) LRU Page Replacement (Least Recently Used)
- AIM: Simulate LRU page replacement; compute page faults.
- REQUIREMENTS: Python 3.x

PROGRAM (lru_page_replacement.py)
```python
# lru_page_replacement.py
def lru_page_replacement(ref_str, frames_count):
    frames = []
    faults = 0
    trace = []
    for page in ref_str:
        if page in frames:
            # mark recently used -> move to end
            frames.remove(page)
            frames.append(page)
            trace.append((page, list(frames), 'H'))
        else:
            faults += 1
            if len(frames) < frames_count:
                frames.append(page)
            else:
                frames.pop(0)  # remove least recently used
                frames.append(page)
            trace.append((page, list(frames), 'F'))
    return faults, trace

if __name__ == "__main__":
    ref = [1,2,3,4,1,2,5,1,2,3,4,5]
    frames = 3
    faults, trace = lru_page_replacement(ref, frames)
    for step in trace:
        print(step)
    print(f"\nPage Faults = {faults}")
```

WORKED EXAMPLE (frames=3)
Reference: 1 2 3 4 1 2 5 1 2 3 4 5

Trace (summarized):
Time | Page | Frames | Result
1 | 1 | [1] | F
2 | 2 | [1,2] | F
3 | 3 | [1,2,3] | F
4 | 4 | [2,3,4] | F (1 evicted LRU)
5 | 1 | [3,4,1] | F (2 evicted)
6 | 2 | [4,1,2] | F (3 evicted)
7 | 5 | [1,2,5] | F (4 evicted)
8 | 1 | [2,5,1] | H (1 moved to MRU)
9 | 2 | [5,1,2] | H
10 | 3 | [1,2,3] | F (5 evicted)
11 | 4 | [2,3,4] | F (1 evicted)
12 | 5 | [3,4,5] | F (2 evicted)

Total page faults = 10

OUTPUT
```
...trace lines...
Page Faults = 10
```

CONCLUSION: LRU approximates optimal replacement; implementable with stacks, counters, or linked lists.

---

12) Sequential File Allocation (Simulation)
- AIM: Simulate sequential (contiguous) file allocation on a disk of fixed-size blocks.
- REQUIREMENTS: Python 3.x

PROGRAM (sequential_file_allocation.py)
```python
# sequential_file_allocation.py
def allocate_sequential(disk_size, files):
    disk = [0]*disk_size  # 0 free, 1 occupied
    allocation = {}
    for fname, size in files:
        found = False
        for start in range(0, disk_size - size + 1):
            if all(disk[start + k] == 0 for k in range(size)):
                for k in range(size):
                    disk[start + k] = 1
                allocation[fname] = list(range(start, start+size))
                found = True
                break
        if not found:
            allocation[fname] = None
    return allocation, disk

if __name__ == "__main__":
    disk_size = 20
    files = [('A',5), ('B',4), ('C',7), ('D',6)]
    allocation, disk_map = allocate_sequential(disk_size, files)
    for f, blocks in allocation.items():
        if blocks is None:
            print(f"{f}: Allocation failed")
        else:
            print(f"{f} -> blocks {blocks}")
    print("Disk map:", disk_map)
```

WORKED EXAMPLE
- Disk size = 20 blocks (indexed 0..19)
- Files:
  - A size 5 -> allocate blocks 0..4
  - B size 4 -> allocate blocks 5..8
  - C size 7 -> allocate blocks 9..15
  - D size 6 -> only blocks 16..19 available (4 blocks) -> allocation fails

Result:
- A -> [0,1,2,3,4]
- B -> [5,6,7,8]
- C -> [9,10,11,12,13,14,15]
- D -> None (allocation failed — insufficient contiguous blocks)

OUTPUT
```
A -> blocks [0,1,2,3,4]
B -> blocks [5,6,7,8]
C -> blocks [9,10,11,12,13,14,15]
D: Allocation failed
Disk map: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]
```

CONCLUSION: Sequential allocation is fast for sequential access, but requires contiguous free space; fragmentation causes allocation failures.

ADDITIONAL NOTES & HOW TO ADAPT
- For all scheduling problems, to include arrival times: add an arrival list and modify logic to pick only processes with arrival <= current time.
- For SJF and Priority with arrival times, use a time-driven loop: at each current time, among arrived and unfinished processes choose minimum burst (SJF) or highest priority.
- For RR, build and print the Gantt chart/time-slice table as shown in the worked example.
- All programs can be modified for user input by replacing hard-coded lists with input() parsing.

If you want, I can:
- Convert each script to accept interactive user input and print neat tables.
- Produce printable PDF lab notes from this markdown.
- Add arrival-time-aware versions of SJF and Priority (with worked examples).

Which of these would you like me to do next?
```
